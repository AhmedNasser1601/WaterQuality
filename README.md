# WaterQuality
Building of classifier models to predict the water potability and calculate the error percentage

 Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. Our goal is to classify the water potability

    Dataset contains: 
      water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies
      with 9 factors affecting the potability of the water
      which Indicates if water is safe for human consumption
    
    where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.

  Project implementation steps are going as follows:
  
    ● Understanding the dataset attributes
    ● Apply the required data preprocessing methods
    ● Divide your dataset to training and testing data
    ● Implement the classification model that suits the project best
    ● Investigate the classifier's performance on detecting the quality of water
    ● Mention your observations and study the features that plays a vital role in water potability.
    ● Use the testing dataset to predict the water potability and calculate the error percentage
