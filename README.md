# WaterQuality
Building of classifier models to predict the water potability and calculate the error percentage

 Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. Our goal is to classify the water potability

    Dataset contains: 
      water quality metrics for 3276 different water bodies
      with 9 factors affecting the potability of the water
      which Indicates if water is safe for human consumption
    
    where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.

  Implementation Steps:

    ● Understanding the dataset attributes
    ● Applying the required data preprocessing methods
    ● Division of dataset into training & testing
    ● Implementation of classification models that best suits the data nature
    ● Investigate the classifier's performance on detecting the quality of water
    ● Mention observations and study features that plays a vital role in water potability
    ● Predict the water potability Quality and calculate the error percentage, based on the testing data

  Bonuses and Extras:

    ● Applying extra techniques in preprocessing to improve accuracy 
    ● Apply different techniques for splitting data into training and testing 
    ● Apply extra Models into data for classification & different testing methods
    ● Try different Visualization graphs for each Model 
    ● Search for getting another available data which can be applied into the model
